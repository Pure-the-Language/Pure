# (Experimental) Plot Library

Status: Usable, Expect Changes

Provides an experimental single-entry straightforward easy-to-use and remember 1D/2D plotting functionalities for numerical and catagorical data: `Plot(XAxis, Optional AXisSeries, Type, Settings)`.  
This component is only responsible for gathering data and saving as pictures - there is a dedicated window based interactive display for viewing data.
This is NOT part of Pure standard and may be removed without further notice.
