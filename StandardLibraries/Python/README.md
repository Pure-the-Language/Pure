# Python

Status: Stable

The Python standard module provides a strong native integration with Python based on pythonnet or CPython implementation, this is in order to provide native data interoperation. The use of Python programming language will be one of the main extension methods for developing in Pure.

## Issues

- [x] `print` will not work because pythonnet didn't implement it. (Comment) This is implemented in the commit [[Python] Implement print](https://github.com/Pure-the-Language/Pure/commit/03b04fe3fbf0f87999a51e2b599b3d4185004f73).
