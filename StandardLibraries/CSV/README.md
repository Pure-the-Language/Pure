# CSV

Pure's own take on CSV parsing, combining benefits of both [Csv by Steve](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Csv) and [CsvHelper by joshclose](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CsvHelper), providing fundational class for other data processing related Pure libraries.

## TODO

- [ ] https://github.com/Pure-the-Language/Pure/issues/34
- [ ] Currently the name of this module (CSV) conflicts with a dll that some of other standard Pure library depends on. The ideal solution is just to purge that dependancy completely.

## Changelog

* v0.1.0: Initialization.
