# Notebook (Pure)

A desktop-local WPF based Jupyter-Notebook-like literate programming client for Pure that is native to Pure (and Windows) and serves as a quick debug-development friendly environment/alternative to Pure CLI/REPL in a fashion similar to iPython. This is the GUI version for Pure that is easier to write and maintain than Righteous and before the C# Terminal port becomes a thing. Unlike Jupyter notebook, this is completely version-control friendly.

## Notebook Format

Notebook is stored in native (GitHub Flavoured) Markdown/HTML including documents, codes, and code result caches.
